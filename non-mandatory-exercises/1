Review:
1.1 What is meant by the CIA triad?
- Confidentiality - the correct person send it
- Integrity - Data has not been tampered
- Availability - Some sort of service is running.

Problems:
1.1 Consider a student information system (SIS) in which students provide a university student number (USN) and a card for account access. Give examples of confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements associated with the system and, in each case, indicate the degree of the importance of the requirement.
- Confidentiality: The card can only be used by the student which it belongs
- Integrity: The cards and the student number can't be changed.
- Availability: The card or the scanner can't be destroyed.

1.4
For each of the following assets, assign a low, moderate, or high impact level for the loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity, respectively. Justify your answers.
a. An organization managing public information on its Web server.
b. A law enforcement organization managing extremely sensitive investigative
information.
c. A financial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy-
related information).
d. An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting organization
contains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine administrative information. Assess the impact for the two data sets separately and the information system as a whole.
e. A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) sys- tem controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administra- tive information. Assess the impact for the two data sets separately and the infor- mation system as a whole.
